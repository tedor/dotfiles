# dotfiles

Configurations for the tools I use every day

## Installation

I use a simple tool called [yadm][yadm] to manage my dotfiles, but it's not
required! However if you're interested in using yadm it's as simple as:

```sh
yadm clone https://github.com/tedor/dotfiles.git
yadm status
yadm bootstrap
```

Otherwise you can copy over individual files and directories as needed.
